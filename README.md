# Hunt: Showdown Server Status Checker

A simple Python script that scrapes the official Hunt: Showdown X.com (formerly Twitter) account to provide quick updates on server status. It checks for current downtime, scheduled maintenance, and when servers are back online.

## Features

-   **Real-time Scraping**: Fetches the 5 most recent tweets from `@huntshowdown`.
-   **Intelligent Analysis**: Uses regular expressions to identify keywords like "servers," "maintenance," and "down" while ignoring them in words like "Showdown."
-   **Context-Aware**: Differentiates between:
    -   üö® **Current Downtime**: Detects if servers are offline right now.
    -   üóìÔ∏è **Scheduled Maintenance**: Identifies announcements for future downtime (e.g., "tomorrow," "on July 9th").
    -   ‚úÖ **Maintenance Complete**: Recognizes when servers are back online.
-   **Downtime Extraction**: Automatically extracts the estimated downtime duration (e.g., "~4 hours") from the tweet if mentioned.
-   **Ignores Noise**: Skips retweets to focus only on original status updates.
-   **Clear Output**: Provides a clean, human-readable summary of the findings.

## How It Works

The script uses the `twikit` library to log into X.com and access the public tweets of the `@huntshowdown` user. It then iterates through the most recent tweets, applying a series of checks:

1.  **Keyword Matching**: It first looks for any relevant keywords using a regular expression that matches whole words only.
2.  **Context Analysis**: If a tweet is deemed relevant, it's analyzed further to determine if the maintenance is `completed`, `scheduled`, or happening `now`.
3.  **Detail Extraction**: The script attempts to find and pull out any mention of the maintenance duration.
4.  **Reporting**: Finally, it prints a formatted status report to the console. If no relevant tweet is found, it reports how long ago the last tweet of any kind was posted.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.7+
-   An active X.com (Twitter) account. **(Using a secondary or dedicated account is highly recommended)**.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the script):**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hunt-server-checker.git
    cd hunt-server-checker
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python library:**
    The script depends on `twikit`, an unofficial library for the X.com API.
    ```sh
    pip install twikit
    ```

## Configuration

Before running the script, you must add your X.com account credentials.

1.  Open the `hunt_server_checker.py` (or your script's name) file in a text editor.
2.  Locate the configuration section at the top of the file.
3.  Replace the placeholder values with your own credentials.

```python
# --- Configuration ---
# IMPORTANT: Replace with your X.com login credentials
USERNAME = "your_x_com_username"
EMAIL = "your_x_com_email"
PASSWORD = "your_x_com_password"
```

> **Security Warning**: Storing credentials directly in a script is not the most secure practice. For personal use, it's acceptable, but it is **strongly recommended to use a dedicated or "burner" X.com account** for this script instead of your personal one to protect your main account's security.

## Usage

Once configured, run the script from your terminal:

```sh
python hunt_server_checker.py
```

The script will print the latest server status directly to your console.

### Example Output (Scheduled Maintenance)
```
Found a potential server status update from @huntshowdown:
-> Tweet: "Hunters, the Live Servers will be taken offline tomorrow, July 9, at 09:00 CEST to deploy an update. Estimated downtime ~4 hours."
   Posted: 0d 18h 32m ago

--- Analysis ---
üóìÔ∏è Status: Scheduled maintenance has been announced.
   - Estimated Downtime: ~4 hours
   - This is a future event. Check the tweet for the exact date and time.
----------------
```

### Example Output (No Status Found)
```
No server status updates found in the last 5 original tweets from @huntshowdown.
The last tweet (of any kind) was 0d 2h 15m ago.
```
